      <p><strong>What are cookies or similar technologies?</strong></p>

      <p>Our Microsite uses cookies to distinguish you from other users. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our content and also allows us to improve our content.</p>

      <p>A cookie is a small text file (letters and numbers) or a piece of code, which often includes a unique identifier. When you visit a website, the website will request to store this text file on your device in order to remember information about you, such as your language preference. Other information gathered through cookies may include the date and time of visits and how you are using a particular website.</p>

      <p>We may also use similar technologies to cookies known as “web beacons”, “pixels”, “tags” or SDKs in our Microsite. The above technologies do a similar job to cookies, allowing operators to count views and understand how users interact with and respond to certain content on a webpage.</p>

      <p>For the purposes of the remaining sections of this Cookie Policy, we refer to all cookies and similar technologies using the above features as “cookies”.</p>

      <p>We may use “first party cookies” and “third party cookies” within our Microsite. First party cookies are cookies placed by us to collect information about you. Third party cookies are cookies placed by third-party operators on our Microsite. Information about you collected by those third party cookies will be shared with the relevant third-party. Please refer to the relevant third-party operator’s privacy notice below for more details about the information they collect and how they use it.</p>

      <p>Please note that our Microsite may also link to external third-party websites which are not operated by us. Where you follow links from our Microsite to the website or platform of a third-party (even if you do not actually leave our Microsite), that website or platform may place different cookies on your device. You should check the relevant privacy notice and/or cookie notice for more information about how that-third party uses cookies.</p>

      <p>You should be aware that applications you use to access our Microsite, such as your website browser, may also place cookies on your device when visiting our Microsite. We do not have control over these third-party cookies, so you will need to manage these cookies in the settings of the relevant applications.</p>

      <p><strong>What are the different types of cookies?</strong></p>

      <p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li><strong>Strictly necessary cookies.</strong> These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Microsite. They include, for example, cookies required for security reasons or fixing bugs.</li>
          <li><strong>Analytical/performance cookies.</strong> They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Microsite when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Microsite work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.</li>
          <li><strong>Functionality cookies.</strong> These are used to recognise you when you return to our Microsite, and may be used to remember your preferences and provide enhanced, more personalised features.</li>
          <li><strong>Targeting cookies.</strong> Targeting cookies (also known as advertising cookies) help advertisers and media publishers to deliver adverts beyond the original website you have visited, for example when you browse a shopping website and then visit a news websites. This is known as ‘retargeting’. This technique helps to ensure that the ads you receive are more relevant to you and your interests. These cookies  help to measure the effectiveness of an ad (for example, by reporting whether you have clicked on it) and can also limit the number of times that you see an ad (for example, if you see it twice but don’t click on it, you may not see it again). These cookies are usually placed by advertising networks that advertisers work with to deliver ads. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other ad networks to show you relevant ads.</li>
          <li><strong>Social media cookies.</strong>  These cookies are used to personalise your interaction with social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Such cookies recognise users of those social media sites when you view social media content on the website. They also allow you to quickly share content across social media, through the use of simple “sharing” buttons.</li>
